# Letter-Grade Assignment
Description of the Problem:

Write a game program. The computer will ask the user to input a score. The program will
first check if the score is valid (between 0 and 100, inclusive). If the score is not valid,
print out the error message and exit the program. Otherwise, display the corresponding
letter grade. .
Requirements:
1. You need first use if statement to decide whether the input is valid. If not, print
out the error message and exit the program.
2. You need use if-else structure to display the letter grade.
3. Comment away the code (do NOT delete it) and rewrite it by using switch
structure (please notice that in general, you may not be able to rewrite an if-else
statement to switch statement. However, in this particular case, there is a trick to
do so easily)
4. In this program, we don’t validate user’s input. We assume that user will enter a
score between 0 and 100 inclusive. After we study loop (Chapter 4), we can
validate the input. As long as the user’s input is out of the legal range, the
program will keep to prompt the user to enter a legal score
